LONG DESCRIPTION
    PSDockerHub is a PowerShell module written to access the official Docker Hub/Registry.
    Its main goal is to to make sure that you have never had to use the public part of Docker Hub site in the browser.

    Most of the APIs used were sniffed using the Chrome DevTools,
    because there is significant fragmentation of APIs between the various Docker offerings.

    You can find API documentation here:

    * https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/api/

    Search is not documented and, the best I could find is this:

    * http://stackoverflow.com/questions/35444178/public-docker-v2-api-endpoints
    * https://github.com/docker/hub-feedback/issues/451

    Please note, that at the moment I have no plans to introduce  support of authorization and private repositories.

    Suggestions, pull requests, and other contributions would be more than welcome!
